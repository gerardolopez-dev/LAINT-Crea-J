            <p class="parrafo2">
              Streetball is a street version of basketball that originated in urban neighborhoods in the United States, especially in New York City during the 1950s.
              It is played in parks and streets, with more flexible rules and a freestyle style that emphasizes creativity and individual talent. It is known for its spectacular plays and its strong connection to urban culture.
            </p>
            <p class="parrafo2">
              In the 1990s, it gained worldwide fame thanks to tournaments like those at Rucker Park and AND1's mixtapes, which showcased players with impressive skills.
              Today, streetball is a cultural expression that combines sport, music, fashion, and art.

            <summary class="titulo2">The culture of StreetBall</summary>
            <p class="parrafo2">
             Streetball culture is an urban expression that combines sport, style, music, and community.
             It goes beyond the game: it's a way of life born in the streets, where creativity, respect, and personal growth are fundamental.
            </p>
            <p class="parrafo2">
              In this culture, style matters as much as skill. Players strive to stand out with unique moves, eye-catching clothing, and an authentic attitude.
              Music, especially hip-hop, often accompanies games, creating an energetic and vibrant atmosphere.
